  "ceasar_desc": " is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques. It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet.",
  "affine": "Affine cipher",
  "affine_desc": " is a type of monoalphabetic substitution cipher, where each letter in an alphabet is mapped to its numeric equivalent, encrypted using a simple mathematical function, and converted back to a letter. Each letter is enciphered with the function (ax + b) mod 26, where b is the magnitude of the shift.",
  "reverse": "Reverse cipher",
  "reverse_desc": " uses a pattern of reversing the string of plain text to convert as cipher text. The process of encryption and decryption is same. To decrypt cipher text, the user simply needs to reverse the cipher text to get the plain text.",

Given two positive numbers a and n, a modulo n (abbreviated as a mod n) is the remainder of the Euclidean division of a by n, where a is the dividend and n is the divisor. The modulo operation is to be distinguished from the symbol mod, which refers to the modulus (or divisor) one is operating from.",

  "simple_substitution_desc": " can be demonstrated by writing out the alphabet in some order to represent the substitution. This is termed a substitution alphabet. The cipher alphabet may be shifted or reversed (creating the Caesar and Atbash ciphers, respectively) or scrambled in a more complex fashion, in which case it is called a mixed alphabet or deranged alphabet.",
  "mod_inverse": "Modular Inverse",
  "mod_inverse_desc": " of an integer a is an integer x such that the product ax is congruent to 1 with respect to the modulus m. In the standard notation of modular arithmetic this congruence is written as ax ≡ 1 (mod m ), which is the shorthand way of writing the statement that m divides (evenly) the quantity ax − 1, or, put another way, the remainder after dividing ax by the integer m is 1.",
